# Completion

## Omni Completion

Omni completion provides smart autocompletion for programs. When invoked, the
text before the cursor is inspected to guess what might follow. A popup menu
offers word completion choices that may include struct and class members,
system functions, and more. A similar feature in Microsoft Visual Studio is
known as IntelliSense.

### Using omni completion

To use omni completion, type `<C-X><C-O>` while open in Insert mode. If matching
names are found, a pop-up menu opens which can be navigated using the `<C-N>` and
`<C-P>` keys.
